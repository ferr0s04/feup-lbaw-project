Web didn't implement specific help for any of the website pages because we don't consider the navigation and actions of any page to be very difficult and not intuitive to the average user. Nevertheless, the user can contact Help Support via email in order to have assistance regarding any matter.

### 4. Input Validation

**Server-side:** register

```
public function register(Request $request)
    {
        $request->validate([
            'name' => 'required|string|max:250',
            'email' => 'required|email|max:250|unique:users',
            'password' => 'required|min:8|confirmed',
            'username' => [
                'required',
                'string',
                'max:150',
                'regex:/^[A-Za-z0-9_.]+$/', // Only letters, numbers, underscores, and dots
                'unique:users', // Ensure the username is unique
            ],
            'role' => 'required|int:1,2'
        ]);
(...)
```

**Client-side:** image upload
``` js
const images = editGameForm.querySelector('input[name="images[]"]').files;
      const maxImages = 5;
      const maxSize = 2 * 1024 * 1024; // 2MB
      let totalSize = 0;
      for (let i = 0; i < images.length; i++) {
        totalSize += images[i].size;
        if (images[i].size > maxSize) {
          imagesErrorDiv.textContent = "Each image must be less than 2MB.";
          imagesErrorDiv.style.display = "block";
          event.preventDefault();
          return;
        }
      }
(...)
```

## A1: PixelMarket

The project involves the development of a web application for an online games shop. This platform aims to provide a seamless experience for users who want to explore, manage, and purchase games online. Our main purpose is to provide a simple yet complete solution where people can find the game they want, easily buy it, and play it afterwards.

As many players are looking for an easy and enjoyable way to purchase their favourite games, our project's primary goal is to create a convenient web application where users can browse a collection of games for different consoles, including both current and classic titles. The platform will enable users to easily search for games by genre, platform or popularity, and manage their purchase history.

Users are grouped based on their access levels: administrators, who will be responsible for managing inventory, pricing, and system functionality; authenticated users, who can purchase games, leave reviews, and rate their experiences; and unauthenticated users, who can browse the game catalogue but cannot purchase any games.

The platform will feature an adaptive design, ensuring a pleasant and smooth browsing and purchasing experience across different devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This online shop aims to provide intuitive navigation, a diverse catalogue, and an engaging user experience.

## A3: Information Architecture

This section presents a brief overview of the system's information architecture. Its goals are to preview the user interface of the system to be developed and to help identify user requirements.

This artifact includes two elements:

1. A sitemap, defining how the information is organized in pages;
2. Two wireframes, representing two of the product's most important pages, that define the content and the functionality for each page.

### 1. Sitemap

![sitemap.drawio](uploads/a33cafc21236a48b2b055b4f4d34a246/sitemap.drawio.png)

### 2. Wireframes

Wireframes are used to describe layout ideas, content, and the overall page-level design. A page wireframe defines how space is allocated and how content is prioritized, including which features are available.

For the PixelForge system, the wireframes for the Home Page (US03) and the Product page (US04).
